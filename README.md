# GAIO

A Matlab toolbox for the global analysis of invariant objects in dynamical systems.  GAIO provides data structures and algorithms for the set-oriented computation of
* invariant sets (maximal invariant set, chain recurrent set, periodic points, global attractor) of arbitrary dimension or topology
* invariant manifolds (stable/unstable manifold of an arbitrary invariant set)
* invariant measures, almost invariant sets, coherent sets
* value functions for optimal control problems

## Installation

After unpacking the archive add the resulting folder to your Matlab path, e.g.

    >> addpath(genpath('/Users/junge/GAIO'))
